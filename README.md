## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
<!-- did not implement these yet -->
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live site](https://manage-landing-page-by-me.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to implement other libraries in a project like the swiper js I used for the testimonials section.

### Continued development

I didn't complete the form validation for this project yet because it is something i'd like to really focus on for my next project. Hopefully, i'll come back to this one in the nearest future.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://swiperjs.com) - This helped me for the testimonials slider section. I really liked this library because it has a lot of wonderful examples and it's very easy to use, once you figure out how to change some default styles. I'll definitely use i again in future projects.
